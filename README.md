# Python Challenge in Ruby

Back in the day when I was learning Ruby, I decided to do the http://www.pythonchallenge.com (in Ruby) to get more acquainted with this language. The quality of the code written back then was not great, but I keep this repository available for other people who might be doing the same challenge.

Each folder represents a level.


## Usage

Go to any folder and type :

    $ ruby solve.rb

You may have missing gems at some point. In which case you can type :

    $ gem install gem_name
