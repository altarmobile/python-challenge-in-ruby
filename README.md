# Python Challenge in Ruby

I decided to do the http://www.pythonchallenge.com in Ruby, to get more acquainted with this language.

Each folder represents a level. Some files may contain personal comments reflecting my Ruby discoveries.


## Usage

Go to any folder and type :

    $ ruby solve.rb

You may have missing gems at some point. In which case you can type :

    $ gem install gem_name
